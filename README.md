# Topic Detection

This project uses the Microsoft Cognitive Services Topic Detection API, within the Text Analytics API suite, to detect topics across a corpus of text documents.

In [request.py](https://github.com/laurentran/topic-detection/blob/master/request.py), we format the data and make the API call to Cognitive Services. The results from the API call are shown in [response.json](https://github.com/laurentran/topic-detection/blob/master/response.json).
